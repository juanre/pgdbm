## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- PostgreSQL 12 or higher
- uv (recommended) or pip

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. Fork and clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pgdbm.git
cd pgdbm
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies with uv:
```bash
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Or with pip:
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

4. Set up pre-commit hooks:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

5. Create a test database:
```bash
createdb pgdbm_test
```

### Running Tests

Run all tests:
```bash
pytest
```

Run with coverage:
```bash
pytest --cov=pgdbm --cov-report=html
```

Run specific test file:
```bash
pytest tests/test_core.py
```

Run with verbose output:
```bash
pytest -v
```

### Code Style

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

- **Black** for code formatting
- **Ruff** for linting
- **mypy** for type checking

Run all checks:
```bash
# Format code
black src tests

# Run linter
ruff check src tests

# Type checking
mypy src
```

Or use pre-commit to run all checks:
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in the `tests/` directory
- Name test files with `test_` prefix
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Use fixtures for common setup
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage

Example test:
```python
async def test_connection_retry(test_db_manager):
    """Test that connection retries work correctly."""
    # Arrange
    config = DatabaseConfig(
        host="invalid-host",
        retry_attempts=3,
        retry_delay=0.1
    )

    # Act & Assert
    with pytest.raises(ConnectionError) as exc_info:
        db = AsyncDatabaseManager(config)
        await db.connect()

    assert exc_info.value.attempts == 3
```

### Documentation

- Update documentation for any changed functionality
- Add docstrings to all public functions and classes
- Include code examples in docstrings
- Update the API reference if you add new public APIs

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Example:
```
Add connection retry logic with exponential backoff

- Implement retry mechanism in AsyncDatabaseManager.connect()
- Add configuration options for retry behavior
- Include exponential backoff with configurable parameters
- Add tests for retry logic

Fixes #123
```
